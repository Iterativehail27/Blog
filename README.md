<h4>Random, personalized, semi-frequent text based repository documenting things that I feel could be helpful to the general public in regards to networking, security, SDN, etc, <br> or just what I accomplished on a given day and felt the need to write about.
  <br><br>
  Also, jotting down things that you wouldn't necessary dedicate an entire guide to or things that are so specific, 
  <br>documenting them also serves to be a reference for that time when you have to do that very specific thing again.
  <br><br>
  ex: troubleshooting POST after a hardware upgrade.</h4>
